# Data Science Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my data science portfolio. This repository showcases my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning through various real-world projects. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in Python and essential data science libraries while solving complex analytical challenges.

## Projects

### 1. COVID-19 Global Impact Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using data from "Our World in Data". This project demonstrates:

- **Advanced Data Visualization** using:
  - Multi-axis plots for comparing cases and deaths
  - Time series trend analysis
  - Box plots for yearly distribution analysis
  - Bar plots for continental comparisons
  - Interactive user-input driven visualizations
- **Statistical Analysis** including:
  - Fatality rate calculations and trends
  - Regional distribution analysis
  - Year-wise monthly trend analysis
- **Data Processing Techniques**:
  - Missing value imputation
  - Feature engineering (e.g., daily growth rates)
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Time-based aggregations

### 2. Titanic Survival Analysis
An exploratory data analysis of the famous Titanic dataset, investigating factors that influenced passenger survival. Key analyses include:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
  - Missing value imputation for Age and Embarked columns
  - Feature engineering (Family Size calculation)
  - Data type handling and column management
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Survival rates by passenger class
  - Age distribution analysis
  - Fare analysis and correlation with survival
  - Family size impact on survival
- **Passenger Demographics**:
  - Class distribution
  - Embarkation port analysis
  - Age and gender distribution
- **Key Findings**:
  - Higher class passengers had better survival rates
  - Age correlation with survival outcomes
  - Family size influence on survival chances
  - Port of embarkation survival patterns
