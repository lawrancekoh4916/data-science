Big Data generated by digitalized processes at economical prices are helping accumulate enormous amounts of data, which can then be processed to generate high-value insights with machine learning. Machine learning refers to a set of algorithms that enables it to recognize patterns from large datasets and then apply these findings to new data. AI, on the other hand, is designed to simulate human thinking by constantly seeking patterns, learning from experience, and providing responses based on situational awareness. High-Performance Computing, with the adoption of new algorithms and new computing tools, has improved the learning ability and usability of AI. Chinese financial institutions are also active here, with players such as Ping An utilizing AI for customer service, investments and insurance products, and fraud detection in the cards business. According to data from CB Insights, total AI funding in 2017 reached $15.2 billion (+144% year over year), spread over 1,349 deals.\n",

One mouse (left) was allowed to age normally without any pharmacologic intervention, while the second mouse (right) was treated with a senolytic agent to periodically eliminate senescent cells. This indicates that the development of acute senescent cells is only briefly interrupted following senolytic treatment. Because the accumulation of senescent cells is thought to occur slowly over months or even years, it is possible that an intermittent dosing approach could be adopted (Figure 14). that are specifically designed to eliminate senescent cells while sparing the normal surrounding tissues. Therefore, use of drugs that can flush out the chronic senescent cells looks like an attractive therapeutic strategy.

Need for major policy changes leading to possibly lower national budget revenues from spectrum sales: DSA would require a major departure from the existing model of exclusive spectrum allocation.

In an extreme case, the wireless market may re-shape toward territorially fragmented, localized high-capacity networks with relatively high efficiency of spectrum utilization under DSA.

Offshore wind installations today account for <4% of total wind installations, with the majority of the wind energy installed base being onshore. Turbine OEMs: Floating offshore technology presents new opportunities for the global wind turbine OEM players, especially to those that currently have exposure to the fixed offshore business. The Carbon Trust estimates that the majority of offshore wind resource is only utilizable through floating offshore structures. Intermittency: Wind power, similar to other renewable energy sources, is disadvantaged by intermittency in nature (i.e., wind does not blow all the time). WindEurope forecasts LCOEs of floating offshore to decline 38% by 2050, and this rate of decline is similar to onshore (-35% by 2050) and fixed offshore (-41%).\n",
